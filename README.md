### Write-up

*Ad Infinitum*, meaning “to infinity” in latin. 

Everyone has had appointments or times where a lab result has been delivered to a specialist but your family doctor doesn’t have access to it or when you need to fill form after form when going to walk in clinics or a new doctor. 

*Infinitum* is meant to be a web app that revolutionizes managing your health care. It will rival current and future health apps that have downfalls such as: only certain physicians using them, needing a subscription and not having all of one’s health files in one place. *Infinitum* is meant to streamline your healthcare and improve health outcomes by providing a comprehensive platform, where appointments can be kept track of, prescriptions easily pulled up on your phone and lab results being at yours and your healthcare providers fingertips. 

*Infinitum* aims to improve communication between healthcare providers and patients.

*Infinitum*'s synchronized platform allows healthcare providers to easily access and cross-reference patients' medical records, reducing the risk of missed diagnoses or treatment errors and improving overall patient outcomes. Ease of upload of files also means traditional mechanical note taking and form filling won't be necessary saving time for more important matters.  

*Infinitum* is for the everyday person allowing them to be more responsible for their medical progress, and be part of it every step of the way, from tracking medications to fitness goals it is meant to help you be more involved in your healthcare.
